## Small farm manager assessment task in NestJS and ReactJS

# Requirements
Create a web application for farm management that consists of one page. It will be used only by one
farmer. He/she can list, add, and remove animals in the system. Every animal has only a “Name”
property that should be unique.
The frontend should be written on React JS. The backend is on NestJs. Use in-memory storage on the
backend.
The source code should be production-ready. The source code should contain a README on how to run
the application locally.

# Assumptions
- Use in-memory in-application storage as DB
- Tests are out of scope (OOS)
